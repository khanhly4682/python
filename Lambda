- Lambda is a small function that is defined without a name.
- Lambda is throw-away function, means that they are just needed once where they have been created.
- Lambda is mainly used in combination with filter(), map() and reduce()

Example 1: 
# Create a add function
 add = lambda x, y: x + y
 print(add(3,5))
 # Output: 8
 
 Example 2:
 # Sort a list
 a = [(1, 2), (4, 1), (8, 10), (13, -3)]
 a.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
 print(a)
 # Output: [(13, -3), (4, 1), (1, 2), (9, 10)]
